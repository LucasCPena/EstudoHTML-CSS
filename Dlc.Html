                    This artbook chronicles the artistic journey of Spiritfarer® the cozy management game about dying, of our small team of artists and how we ended up making what became Thunder Lotus’ most ambitious game ever. For us, Spiritfarer has been an act of love, sincerity and earnestness. From its smallest icons to its largest environments, everything in Spiritfarer has been drawn, animated and crafted with enormous care. We hope you enjoy the journey through these pages as much as we did!
